# Admin Feature Implementation Status

## Completed

### 1. E2E Test Suite
✅ Created comprehensive e2e tests for admin functionality:
- `admin-dashboard.spec.ts` - Admin dashboard navigation and overview
- `admin-analytics.spec.ts` - Analytics, player management, leaderboards, system status
- `admin-simulated-games.spec.ts` - Simulated game creation and monitoring
- `admin-ai-behavior.spec.ts` - AI behavior observation and analysis

### 2. Admin Components
✅ Created basic admin UI components:
- `AdminDashboard.tsx` - Main admin dashboard with navigation
- `PlayerManagement.tsx` - Player list and management interface
- `GameAnalyticsView.tsx` - Game analytics with time filtering
- `LeaderboardView.tsx` - Player rankings and leaderboards
- `SystemStatus.tsx` - System health monitoring and configuration

### 3. API Integration
✅ Set up API client integration:
- Configured `@power-grid/api-client` from local package
- Created `adminApi.ts` service for API calls
- Built the API client package successfully

### 4. Type Definitions
✅ Created TypeScript types:
- `admin.ts` - Admin-specific type definitions
- `api-client.ts` - Mock types for development

## Current Status

The admin panel is now accessible from the main menu and includes:
- Overview dashboard with server status
- Player management with search and filtering
- Game analytics with time-based filtering
- Leaderboards with multiple views
- System status monitoring with logs and configuration

## Next Steps

### 1. Backend Implementation
- Implement admin API endpoints in the Go server
- Add WebSocket handlers for real-time updates
- Create database schema for analytics data

### 2. Simulated Games Feature
- Add UI for creating simulated games
- Implement AI player configuration
- Create game monitoring interface
- Add real-time updates via WebSocket

### 3. AI Behavior Analysis
- Implement AI decision logging
- Create visualization components
- Add performance metrics tracking
- Build export functionality

### 4. Enhanced UI Features
- Add charts using Recharts library
- Implement data export functionality
- Add real-time updates for metrics
- Create mobile-responsive layouts

### 5. Testing
- Fix WebSocket connection detection in tests
- Add mock API responses for testing
- Create integration tests with backend
- Add visual regression tests

## Running the Admin Panel

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the main menu and click "Admin Dashboard"

3. The admin panel will attempt to fetch data from:
   - Server API: `http://localhost:4080`
   - WebSocket: `ws://localhost:4080/ws`

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all admin tests
npm run test:e2e -- admin-*.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui -- admin-*.spec.ts

# Run a specific test file
npm run test:e2e -- admin-dashboard.spec.ts
```

Note: Tests currently expect the backend to be running with admin endpoints implemented.
